# Latex in Docker

Inspired in the discontinued `tianon/latex`, this image is based on the latest
Debian distribution and contains the latest latex packages installed (biber,
latexmk, texlive-full). Works best in combination with Latex Workshop and
VSCode.

Just pull with `docker pull enolgor/latex` to use.
